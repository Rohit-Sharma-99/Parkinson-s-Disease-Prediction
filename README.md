# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction
This project predicts Parkinson's disease using machine learning by analyzing medical data, including voice-related features. It involves data preprocessing, training various models (SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.), and evaluating their performance to predict whether an individual has Parkinson's disease or not.
