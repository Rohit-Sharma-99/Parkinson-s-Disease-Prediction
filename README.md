# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has Parkinson's Disease or not based on various features. The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals with Parkinson’s disease, such as voice-related features, which have been analyzed to build a predictive model. The project applies machine learning techniques to predict Parkinson’s disease, using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

## Objective
- Predict the likelihood of a person having Parkinson's Disease based on specific features.
- Implement and evaluate machine learning models to predict the disease.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Numerical computations.
- `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `matplotlib`: Plotting visualizations.
- `sklearn`: Machine learning algorithms and tools for evaluation.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and perform necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps.
   - Handle missing data, if any, and scale/normalize the features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the distribution of features using seaborn and matplotlib.
   - Generate insights through statistical analysis of the dataset.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Implement classification algorithms: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
   - Train and test models, evaluate their accuracy, and analyze performance using metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the models using various performance metrics.
   - Compare the results of both models and determine the best performing one.

## Results
- The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy score of **XX%** while the Logistic Regression model achieved **YY%** accuracy.
- The confusion matrix and classification report further demonstrate the precision, recall, and F1-score of the models.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting Parkinson's Disease based on voice-related features. The Random Forest Classifier showed the best performance in this case. This model can potentially help in early detection, aiding in timely intervention for better treatment and management of Parkinson's Disease.
